            <h2>Wanna hear me talk about some pizza? Yeah you do.</h2>
            <p>
                So actually pizza is probably one of the best foods ever, and if
                you don't like it, it's porbably because 
                your parents never loved you when you were a kid and all you had
                to eat was like carrots or leaves or something.
                Statisically people with divorced parents and families are less 
                likely to like pizza because their life is really miserable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite pizza includes the limited edition Papa John's
                Shaqoroni, and a thin crust pizza from 
                <a href="https://www.artichokepizza.com">
                Artichoke's at Berkeley, CA.

            <h2>I think that there are other things that I can talk about</h2>
            <p>
                Dogs are some of the coolest thingies in the world, and they
                could even be cooler than... The New Nintendo Switch 2 which you 
                should totally buy today right 
                <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-offers/">here</a>
                . By the way I'm not sponsored
                in any way shape or form, i jus think that it's important to make
                a point.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of people have favorite dogs, but mine's is Japanese. 
                what does that mean??? It means that I'm obviously talking about the only Japanese
                dog in the world. I kinda like Shiba Inus so if anyone has a spare
                they can hand it right over to me. That even includes if you just have one
                i wouldn't mind taking it from you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people however like other dogs, just like for example.......
                Corgis. So what they have a <strong>big</strong> butt, no one really cares.
                But I guess they're kinda cool. In any case you can see that dogs are 
                pretty cool too.
            </p>
            <table>
                <p>Here is a table with some dogs, didn't think I could code that
